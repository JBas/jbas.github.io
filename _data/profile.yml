description: Heyo! I am a recent graduate from CMU and interested in that middle-ground between software and hardware, although lately I've been taking on hardware projects. I've had experience working with C/C++, Python, and some other high-level programming languages, and on the other side of the abstraction, I'm also developing my skills in ARM Assembly, RISC-V Assembly, and reading ISAs. I think FPGA's are pretty cool, and I get excited whenever I have the chance to use them. I've spent a summer and a semester honing my PCB design skills through a medical device internship, and I expect to continue to do so in future projects!
